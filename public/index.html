						Walchand College of Engineering is situated midway
						between Sangli and Miraj cities at Vishrambag, Sangli.
						The WCE campus is located on about 90 acres of land on
						southern side of Sangli - Miraj road. In 1947, the
						college made a modest beginning as New Engineering
						College, with a single program leading to B.E. (Civil)
						degree.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the year 1955, the College was renamed as Walchand
						College of Engineering as part of the new arrangements
						and pursuant to the Rehabilitation and Development
						Program mainly funded by Seth Walchand Hirachand
						Memorial Trust and the Government.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Ad Hoc Committee added two more degree programs in
						B.E. (Mechanical) and B.E. (Electrical) in 1955 with the
						intake of 20 each. Three Diploma programs also started
						in 1955 - Civil (40 intake), Mechanical (20) and
						Electrical (20).
